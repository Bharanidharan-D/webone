<p>Web Engineering is the application of systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approaches to development, operation, and maintenance of Web-based applications. It is both a pro-active approach and a growing collection of theoretical and empirical research in Web application development. Web-based systems and applications now deliver a complex array of functionality to
a large number of diverse groups of users. As our dependence and reliance on the Web
has increased dramatically over the years, their performance, reliability and quality
have become paramount importance. As a result, the development of Web applications
has become more complex and challenging than most of us think. In many ways, it is
also different and more complex than traditional software development. But, currently,
the development and maintenance of most Web applications is chaotic and far from
satisfactory. To successfully build and maintain large, complex Web-based systems and
applications, Web developers need to adopt a disciplined development process and a
sound methodology. The emerging discipline of Web engineering advocates a holistic,
disciplined approach to successful Web development. In this chapter, we articulate and
raise awareness of the issues and considerations in large, complex Web application
development, and introduce Web engineering as a way of managing complexity and
diversity of large-scale Web development.</p>
